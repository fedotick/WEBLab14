## Tasks

1. Write a script that determines the zodiac sign and eastern horoscope sign by year based on the date of birth.

2. Create a code that outputs all prime numbers from 2 to 10.

3. Let's pretend we have a riddle: "What is it: blue, big, with a mustache, and completely full of hares?" Answer: a trolleybus. You can argue, of course, what color trolleybuses are now - but that's not what we're talking about.  Let's imagine that you are giving this riddle to a user. Create a program that reads the answer from the console:
   - the user has 3 tries. After three answers, the program should terminate;
   - if the user enters "Trolleybus", we output "Correct!" to the console and exit the loop;
   - if the user enters "I give up", we output "Correct answer: trolleybus." to the console and exit the loop;
   - if the user enters any other answer, we output to the console "Think again." and continue the loop.

4. A merchant is selling five different products whose prices are as follows: product1, $2.98; product2, $4.50; product3, $9.98; product4, $4.49; È™i product5, $6.87. Create a script that reads a pair of numbers:
   1. Product number (from 1 to 5)
   2. The quantity sold
  
   The program should use a `switch` statement that will determine and output to the HTML page the price of each product, and calculate the total cost of the products sold. Use the `prompt` function to enter values. Entering values should end with the value 0 for the product number.
